To handle resturant orders in seqenuce a queue data structure must be used , that will allow orders to be processed in order they came in.
Operations required would be enqueue to add the orders, dequeue to remove them, isEmpty to find of the queue is empty and isFull to find if the queue is full
To stop if from overflowing or underflowing we will check is the full when adding new orders, and check if is empty when dequeuing
Order will be completed and printed in the order they arrived , since Queue works on FIFO, first-in  first- out bases
